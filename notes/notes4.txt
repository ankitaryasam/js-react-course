function:-

function is a block/set of code to perform some logic/task

While writing any code or developing any application, there is requirement to separate the logics. That's why we write functions.

userLogin, userRegistration, commentOnPost, addNewPost and etc

Here, from the above examples when you want to write the logic/code for such activities. In this case, we will create functions.

=> Code inside the function is not automatically executed
=>To execute the function code, Function must be called explicitly(by the programmer).
=> We can call the function n number of times.
=> calling the function means invocation of function

Function Parameters:-
Parameters - Parameters are additional information that we can pass to functions.


FUNCTION RETURNS
Sometimes it is our requirement to make our function returning some value/data so, that we can use returned data further in our code.


We can pass the value for the parameters. these passed values are generally known as arguements.

function can return anything...also a function can return nothing means void
